# ev3-prothonics
Lego Ev3 Mindstorms robot project that mainly uses Prolog to perform reasoning.

## Dependencies

1. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
2. [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)
3. [Pyswip](https://github.com/yuce/pyswip)
4. [Prothonics](https://github.com/agnsal/prothonics)

## Issues

To install numpy, swi-prolog and pyswip, using `sudo apt install python3-*` command is recommended instead of pip3. 

If pip3 used and not working properly on ev3dev-strech, then try using `sudo python3 -m pip install *`  command.
